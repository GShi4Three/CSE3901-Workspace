For Project 4, our team worked together to redesign Professor Shaileshh Bojja Venkarakrishnan's site with the use of Middleman.

To properly run the website through Middleman, make sure Middleman is istalled, then run the command 'middleman serve'. This should start a local server where the website will be running and is accessible from.

Individual Contributions:

Gavin Shi: Resposible for creating the Middleman project, styling all pages, and creating the News and Teaching Pages

Amir Shaltami: Responsible for creating the Home Page

JT Vendetti: Responsible for creating the Research Page

Khaled Saleh: Responsible for creating the Students Page
