For Project 4, our team worked together to redesign Professor Shaileshh Bojja Venkarakrishnan's site with the use of Middleman.

To properly run the website through Middleman, make sure Middleman is istalled, then run the command 'middleman serve'. This should start a local server where the website will be running and is accessible from.
