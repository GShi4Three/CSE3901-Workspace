The assigned work for Project 2 was for our team to work together to create calculator functions with and without built in methods. In category 1, work was split evenly with Gavin working on #1, JT working on #2, Khaled working on #3, and Amir working on #4. For category 2, work was assigned based on the colored blocks. JT worked on the grey block, Gavin worked on the yellow block, Khaled on green, and Amir on blue. Finally, for category 3, we hopped in a Discord call to discuss solutions and worked together coding the operation that was able to handle basic arithmetic operations and respect order of operations.
